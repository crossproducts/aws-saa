### Types of Storage:


1. Block Storage (EBS, Instance Store)
Structure: Data is stored in fixed-sized blocks and managed at the block level.
Access: Low-latency access via attached storage to an instance (like a hard drive or SSD).
Use Case: Ideal for databases, virtual machines, and applications requiring frequent read/write operations.
Examples:
Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) ‚Äì Persistent storage for EC2 instances.
Instance Store ‚Äì Ephemeral storage directly attached to EC2 instances.
2. File Storage (EFS, FSx)
Structure: Data is stored in a hierarchical directory structure (like a traditional file system).
Access: Multiple instances/clients can access the same shared storage using file protocols (NFS, SMB).
Use Case: Ideal for shared storage across multiple applications, containerized workloads, and analytics.
Examples:
Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) ‚Äì A fully managed NFS file system for Linux workloads.
Amazon FSx ‚Äì Fully managed file systems, including:
FSx for Windows File Server ‚Äì SMB file shares for Windows workloads.
FSx for Lustre ‚Äì High-performance file storage for HPC and ML.
3. Object Storage (S3, Glacier)
Structure: Data is stored as objects with metadata and a unique identifier in a flat namespace.
Access: Accessed via API over HTTP(S), optimized for high durability and scalability.
Use Case: Best for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as backups, media files, logs, and machine learning datasets.
Examples:
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) ‚Äì Highly scalable and durable storage.
Amazon Glacier ‚Äì Low-cost, long-term archival storage.
